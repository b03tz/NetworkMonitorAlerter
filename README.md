# NetworkMonitorAlerter

This app will monitor the bandwidth that each of your processes use on your system. It will monitor upload and download and send you a notification it it surpasses an x amount of bandwidth for down and upload.

For instance you can set it to trigger on 15MB per 5 minutes (default settings) and it will show you a notification that a process hit that 'limit'.

After that you can choose to whitelist the app for an hour, a day or infinite or not whitelist it at all (which will trigger notifications again).

I made this to monitor the bandwidth usage of my processes that upload or download stuff without me knowing.

It requires administrative privileges!
